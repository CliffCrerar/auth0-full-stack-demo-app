# Angular front end

## Secure navigation and authentic http traffic

The reason angular was selected is because it is well equipped to deal with standard security practice in terms of a single page application. It provides a simple and elegant interface for route guarding as an attribute of the routing configuration. The most power-full of its features is the ability to create an http call interceptor that catches all outgoing http traffic and preform universal operations on the objects in transit. A typical use case is attaching a bearer token provided by the authentication service to each server call providing secure and authentic traffic between client and server.
