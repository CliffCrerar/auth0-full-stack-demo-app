# Requirements
We'd like you to build something so we can have a chat about how you've built it; and what you've learned from the process of building it. For the role you've chosen, we wanted to give you the chance to build something back-end related.We know folks can be quite particular about what frameworks they like to use, so we've given a couple options for what you can choose to build:

## 1. JSON API with ExpressJS
We'd like to see how you set up API Authentication and structure the requests and responses. Create an API that allows a consumer to create, read, update, and delete "products". We don't care what the products look like, or where/how they're stored.

## 2. JSON API with AdonisJS
We'd like to see how you familiarise yourself with a larger framework; to structure API requests and responses. Create an API that allows a consumer to create, read, update, and delete "products". They should be saved in a relational database. We don't care about what fields are saved, but feel free to get creative. Bonus points if you can authenticate the API, but it's not a requirement.

## What we're looking for...
We want to see how you go about creating an app. The goal isn't to have a complete or perfect or production-ready thing (unless that's important to you). It's to have something to discuss, so we can get a better idea of how you work and communicate.
